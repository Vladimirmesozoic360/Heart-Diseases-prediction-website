# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System

A **Machine Learning–based web application** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.  
This project uses a trained Logistic Regression model integrated with a Flask web interface.

---

## 📋 Overview

The Heart Disease Prediction System is designed to assist healthcare professionals and patients in identifying potential heart disease risks early.  
Users can input medical data through an intuitive web form, and the system provides instant feedback on whether the data indicates a **healthy heart** or a **defective heart**.
